# blast test vector

`test.pk` and `test.txt` are copied unchanged from zlib `contrib/blast/test/`
(https://github.com/madler/zlib/tree/develop/contrib/blast). `test.pk` is a
PKWare DCL imploded stream that decompresses to `test.txt`. The DBC decoders
in `src/omnisus_db/sources/datasus_ftp/dbc.py` and
`native/omnisus-db-dbf/src/dbc.rs` are altered ports of `blast.c`, distributed
under this notice:
