"""DATASUS DBC: a DBF header, a CRC32, then a PKWare DCL imploded body.

The decoder below is an altered port of Mark Adler's blast.c (zlib
contrib/blast, version 1.3). Altered: it reads an in-memory buffer, appends to a
growing output instead of a 4 KiB window, and raises InvalidDbcError instead of
returning codes. ``native/omnisus-db-dbf/src/dbc.rs`` carries the same port.
